# Getting there & what to know

## By car
From Kharkiv via Zmiiv along the P‑78 — about 46 km. Some access roads to the river are unpaved. In the navigator: “Zadonetske, Kharkiv Oblast”.

## Train + bus
Take a local train to Zmiiv station, then bus/taxi/bike ~7 km to Zadonetske. Direct buses Kharkiv ↔ Zmiiv run daily; some routes toward Koropove/Korobovi Khutory pass closer to the village (timetables change).

## National park rules
- Make fires only at designated sites.
- Pack out all trash; protect sandy slopes and pine plantations.
- Swimming/fishing: mind currents and depths; supervise children.
- Do not feed wildlife; keep dogs on a leash.
