# History (brief)
The Siverskyi Donets valley has been inhabited since ancient times — from the Neolithic through the “Wild Field” era. In the 17th–18th centuries, the Zmiiv Cossack St. Nicholas Monastery stood on nearby Kozacha Hora, a spiritual and partly defensive center of Slobozhanshchyna; today its ruins and a memorial stone remain. In the 20th century the area evolved as a dacha/holiday locality; a seven‑year school opened in the 1920s (later eight‑year).

Since 2020, Zadonetske has been part of the Zmiiv urban hromada (Chuhuiv district) under Ukraine’s administrative reform. Today it’s a popular nature getaway and a convenient gateway to Homilshanski Lisy National Park.
